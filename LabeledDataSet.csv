Eng Findings: C307 was shut down for the following:
- 3LP vlave leak, 3LP ring failure, and 2LP valve leak. All valves were replaced, and the whole piston rod assembly was replaced. The ring grooves on the piston are non standard so the whole assembly is replaced. We also drained and refilled the lbe oil reservoir because the Tan (total acid number) was high. this ultimatley was being caused by oxygen in the oil reservoir. We found the nitrogen purge off on all thre compressors. - PT 12/15/2015

The valves failed due to liquid condensing from the process gas. Engineering is working towards a solution involving heat tracing that will prevent the gas from condensing.

Eng Findings: Compressor was shut down for 1hP, 2HP, and 1LP valve replacement. All of these valves ran more than 2 years. 2 HP initiated the repair when the valve body bolt came loose and floated into a valve port. The bolt held a moppet upen and mimicked a valve failure. 1 HP was also exhibiting a small leakage. 3HP PV looked like bad piston rings. 

during the repair we pulled the piston on 3HP to replace the rings. the rings were in really good condition. There was little to no wear on the piston rings so the piston was reinstalled. 

Delayed restart selected because during the reinstallation of the piston rod the crosshead started lifting. The Dresser crew lost maybe a shift trying to get the crosshead to sit down. Eventually we found anumber of burrs or nick marks on the leveling washer. I can only summize that these burrs were bending the rod when torque was applied. WE lapped the leveling washer and performed a blue contact check. blie contact was improved and the crosshead sat down after reinstallation. -PT 2/10/2016",C-307,1,1/5/2016,C-307 VALVE FAILED,1HP_2HP_1LP_VLV,LEAK,REPLACE

F) and the 2nd and 3rd Stage LP – HE suction valves to reach Alert alarms (130 deg. F).  Leaks on all three cylinders are confirmed in the PV curves in System 1.  The machine was left running and will be shut down 4/24/12 for the work to begin 4/25/12.  It is recommended to replace all the valves in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Stage LP cylinders.  The 1st and 3rd Stage LP valves have been in service since the 2011 Major outage (approx.10 months), and the 2nd Stage LP valves were last replaced during the 1/26/12 outage (3 months).

The three cylinders on the HP side of the machine currently do not show evidence of leaking valves based upon their PV curves and temperatures in System 1.  However, due to the age of the 2nd and 3rd Stage HP valves – 9 months and 10 months, respectively – consideration was given to replace them during this outage.  The 1st Stage HP valves have been in service since December 2011 (4.5 months) and would also be replaced proactively during the outage to complete the machine.

Recent step changes in temperatures and leakage of the 2nd Stage HP South CE suction valve has limited the capacity of the C307 and at times has caused the 1st Stage discharge RV to lift.  There was also an increase in temperature on the 2nd Stage HP South CE discharge valve, supporting something passed through the machine (i.e. liquid or debris).  It is recommended to replace all of the valves in the cylinder and repair the 1st Stage HP discharge PSV4063.  The valves have been in service for approximately 62 days.  

In addition to the 2nd Stage HP valves, the 2nd Stage LP HE suction valves are leaking as well.  These valves were noted to be leaking upon start up on at the beginning of May 2012.

The suction valve is running approximately 140-145 deg. F, ~35 deg. F higher than the other suction valves in the cylinder.  The machine is currently running and has not lifted the RV.  The step change in temperature does not mean an immediate failure, but based the historical data it may lead to a bigger issue in the near future.  It is recommended to replace all the valves in the cylinder.  Also, further evaluation in System 1 revealed that the 1st Stage LP West discharge valve also had increased temperatures and seems to be leaking.  Again, it is recommended to replace all of the valves in the cylinder.  Both sets of valves have been in service since the beginning of August 2011 (6 months).

In addition to those issues, the inner packing on the 3rd Stage HP has elevated in temperature recently climbing close to 150 deg. F (Alarm @ 150F), and given the opportunity of the machine being down it is recommended to be replaced.  While working the piston and rod assembly and replacing the packing, it is also recommended to replace the piston rings and rider bands in the 3rd Stage HP due to the length of service (2.5+ years).  The valves for the cylinder are recommended to be replaced since we are going into the cylinder, even though there are no signs of a failure.

Prior to shutting down C307 for a maintenance outage C308 was loaded up early Sunday 7/1/12 morning.  Upon doing so, it appears the head end suction valve on the 3rd Stage HP cylinder failed.  It is recommended to replace all of the valves in the cylinder.  The valves have been in service for approximately 118 days.  With the failure of the 3HP suction valve the 2nd Stage HP discharge valves have seen an increase in temperature as well.  The head end valve temperatures have climbed past the Danger (290 deg. F), reaching 309 deg. F. These valves have been in service 222 days and will be replaced.  With such elevated temperature there is a concern for rider damage.  The rider bands and piston rings are recommended to be replaced.

Additional recommended work scope items include the scope of a basic PM.  This includes the replacement of valves for all 4 additional cylinders, replacement of the piston and rod assembly on the 3rd Stage LP due to leaking piston rings, a crosshead inspection on the 1st Stage HP due to a knock and repair of the 1st Stage unloaders.

CTRAC0176,"Eng Finding: : Because both the LP and HP sides of the compressor were unloaded, the compression ratio increases were more sensitive to trap blow downs. The compressor traps were put into local control after this trip. The lowering suction pressure causes the 3rd stage compression ratio to increase. The cross head vibraiton is increasing with the increase of the comrpession ratio - PT11/8/2015

The compressor is set up with an automatic trap blow down. In this case the compressor tried to blow down while it was unloaded which casued the compression ratio to increase and it triped on vibration. Operations will try to limit the amount of time that the compressor is unloaded to prevent this from happening again. In addition, engineering is progressing 2 methods that will help dampen crosshead vibration: 1) grout in the crosshead guide, & 2) add suplimental oil to the crosshead guide. - PT 11/10/2015

Ops Finding: :  
   Incident Description:    At 4:46 PM, C308 alarm on high liquid level in HP 3rd Stage so 37LC406 opens wide open to clear liquid level per controller design. At 4:47 PM, a West Recip Trouble Alarm 37XA064 occurs and about a second later a West Recip Shutdown alarm indicating C308 shutdown. Operators immediately reported that C308 shutdown due to high vibration on 3rd Stage HP side while going through alarm panel and Bentley system. This occur yesterday around the same time on the same machine and on the same liquid trap.   
      

   Executive Summary:    C308 shutdown due to HP 3rd Stage high vibrations.   
      

   Immediate Corrective Actions Taken:    Determine root cause that shutdown C308 and immediately contact on call Rotating Engineer for an approval for restart. C308 was restarted and unit is on recovery mode.   
      

   Recommended Actions:    Place all liquid trap on Local control and increase rounds on C308 liquid traps to prevent machine from shutting down due to liquid trap opening wide open.   
      

   Key Learnings:    C307 3rd Stage HP liquid trap build liquid level and trap 37LC106 open wide open to clear liquid with no shut down impact of machine.

Eng Finding: Work progressed in the Month of May. This wo order status was changed from N to Y. (yes it was repaired.)

During the disassembly there was excessive wear discovered on the 3rd and 8 th staged. There was some light wear on other stages. The pump appeared to have thrusted at some point in the past. The keys that hold the diffuser wear rings in place were pushed out on the 3rd impeller. PT-6/14/2015
Thrust/pushed keys were later determined to be damage caused during the disassembly. That did not occur during the run. The excessive wear on the wear rings would have caused extreme recirculation inside the pump and loss of capacity. This damage occured during pump start up. the pump never put up the rate it should have. - PT 7/1/2015

This would have drawn more torque and power from the motor at start-up. The coupling may need resizing. when couplings are specified we try to optimize the weight of the coupling with the required torque. THis may have been undersized slightly or sized off of running torque and not max starting toque. - PT 8/14/2015

Ops Finding: Summary Notes
RCFA
*Symptom - Product Leakage, Seal
*System - Seal
*Failure Mode - Seal
*Failure Cause - Seal Clogged
Discussion
The secondary seal faces were polished and contaminated with solids from process. This indicates API plan 54 flush was not operable
which resulted in a leak.
The configuration of the small bore seal chamber makes installation of the seal difficult, the seal gland can be bent during installation.
Recommendations
Ensure API plan 54 is operable at all times.
Upgrade the small bore seal chamber to a big bore seal chamber to enable a larger, stronger seal gland to be installed.
